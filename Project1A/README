This is a README file with identification information, a description of the included files, and references about Project 1A of CS111 Spring 2018.
/* Many thanks to the legendary TA Zhaoxing Bu for providing explanations on sample code and awesome discussion section. */

lab0.c:
	This is the source file of project 1A. This project gives us hands on practice on setting up non-canionical input mode, pipes between the terminal and the shell and interprocess communication. The compiled program allows us to read and write between shell and terminal from both directions. 

	The options are listed as follow:

		default (no option): Character-at-a-time, full duplex terminal I/O. 

		--shell: Mode that passes input/output between the terminal and a shell

		--debug: for debugging purpuses when develping (this portion has been commented out/removed)

Makefile:
	dist:
		Compresses the files into .tar for grading.
	clean:
		Removes all the tar file and txt files.
	default:
		Compiles lab0.c with the GCC compiler under C99 mode
